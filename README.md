Chess Game in Rust
This project is a simple implementation of a chess game written in Rust. It features a command-line interface (CLI) for player input, allowing two players to play a game of chess on the same machine. The game supports all basic chess rules, including pawn promotion, castling, and en passant captures.

Features
CLI for Game Input: Players can input their moves in standard algebraic notation (e.g., "e2e4").
Full Chess Rules: Supports all basic movements and captures, including special moves like castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.
Turn-Based Gameplay: Alternates turns between the white and black players.
Board Display: Displays the game board in the console with Unicode chess pieces.

How to Play
After starting the game, the board will be displayed in your terminal. Players take turns inputting their moves in standard algebraic notation. For example, to move a pawn from e2 to e4, type e2e4 when prompted.

Commands
Move: Input your move in algebraic notation (e.g., "e2e4").
Quit: Type quit or exit to stop the game (not implemented by default, add if applicable).
